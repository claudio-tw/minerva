\section{Introduction}
We describe 
a novel approach to supervised feature selection 
based on 
neural estimation of mutual information 
between
features 
and 
targets.


Recall distinction between
on the one hand
wrappers and embedded methods,
on the other hand
filters. 
The former are model-dependent selection procedures,
the latter are model-free selection algorithms.
Minerva is a filter algorithm for feature selection.
